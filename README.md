The idea is to take any 81-char Sudoku String and "morph" it into another 81-char string of "canonical" order. I use it on already solved sudoku strings, but it may work on valid sudoku puzzle strings a well?  Make sure it meets all the criteria of a "proper" sudoku puzzle.  It must have 8 of the 9 sudoku digits present.  Actually may work on other grid sizes, but I have never tried.  

Read about "Minimal Lexographic" [minlex] order (dictionary order) from Ali Assaf some ten years ago.
He was a PhD student then.
