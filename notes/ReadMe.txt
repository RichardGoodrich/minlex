Did this on MX Linux

I installed the UV Python Environment
  https://docs.astral.sh/uv/pip/environments/

And used the latest JetBrains Toolbox and the Full PyCharm
(which reverts to Community Edition after 30 day trial)

Set up Project to UV and created a minlex project and copied
the minlex.py that "1to9only" from the New Sudoku Player's Forum
created for me as Version 1.00

I just copied his code into a main.py and went from there:

ran from terminal both of these ways.  My command prompt is just: ">"
