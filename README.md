The idea is to take any 81-char Sudoku String and put into another 81-char string in a "canonical" order. I use it on already solved sudoku strings, but it may work on valid sudoku puzzle strings a well?

Read about "Minimal Lexographic" [minlex] order (dictionary order) from Ali Assaf some ten years ago.
He was a PhD student then.
